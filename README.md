# BME280

Developed a driver for the BME280 for use with the STM32F407 microcontroller as a personal project using C and the datasheets for the BME280 sensor and the STM32F407 to provide an easy interface between them. The driver allows the microcontroller to read temperature (C), pressure (kPA) and humidity (%).
